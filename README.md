# Haunted Hunch
A board game created by Mustafa Azyoksul

## Background
The idea of this board game first started at middle school. I loved board games and wanted to create one of my own. I got inspired by board games like chess, checkers and most importantly arimaa.

## Info
This repo contains a WPF based desktop version of the game that can be played on a single computer with slight rule changes. You can play the online version on Android. Domain of the game is well documented. Feel free to use any portion of the code.
If you are interested in making your own board game, you can ask me anything your hearth desire to know. I would be glad to help ^^

## Play
There is an online multiplayer version of the game made on Unity and currently on Google Play Store. You can download the game at play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.glamerhunch.hauntedhunch. When you press play, the game matches you with another player in the queue.

## Disclaimer!
Unfortunately the Android game is down as of Feb 2020 due to a bug on online servers. I will fix it as soon as possible.
